best practices

how do you name variables, functions, classes etc. good to be overlyspecific.
Keep the same structure.

What does the variable do? "number" is better than "n".

What are you going to do with the number?

let n = 10;
let number = 10;
let numberToMultiply = 10;

console.log(n*10)
console.log(number*10)
console.log(numberToMultiply*10)

if you are specific with your naming conventions you don't have to use a lot of comments
The code already explains what it does. It is important to keep the code managable and modular.
Clean code.


Refactoring

Do it again, do it right.

Code it, step back, clean it.

Improve code in iterations?


I've done this feature and it works but it might not follow best practice and i know i can do better. Its not going to work on safari v12. 
^^^^^---- when you are aware of this is called tech debt. Code rot, the code you were supposed to fix but never did.
